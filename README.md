This project is a full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Socket.io. It supports private messaging, online/offline user indicators, and JWT-based authentication for secure access. The backend manages users and messages, storing them in MongoDB, while providing protected API routes and real-time socket connections. The React frontend features authentication forms, a live sidebar of users, and private chat panels with instant updates. Deployed on Render (backend) and Netlify (frontend), it demonstrates a modern, production-ready real-time messaging system with persistent data storage and seamless client-server interaction.
